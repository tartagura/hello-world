# hello-world
First repository.

I'm just reading GitHub's guide and learning how to use it, don't mind me now.

Today was a regular day in which nothing really happened. But right now, I am all powerful, and can write whatever I want.

Once upon a time, there was a gigantic dark furred creature with large teeth. It also had wings.
Somehow, the creature destroyed its own planet. Now, in its endless search for carnage, the monstrosity floats around the countless galaxies, looking for the next planet to ravage.
